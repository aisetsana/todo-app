# Todomate
Just a simple and small task managment app, includes barebone features made mainly as getting comfortable around [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

**!!DISCLAIMER!!** This is by no means a finished ready-to-use product, it's just me messing around in raylib. 


# Usage
**(Note that this app is made purely for Windows experience)**
* Clone the repository.
* Include raylib lib
* Compile and run using the *run.bat* file (May need to compile the rc file to get an icon!)
* win
